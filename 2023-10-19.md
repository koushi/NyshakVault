As Ioulaum perfected his greatest spell, Ioulaum’s longevity,
Karsus, at the age of 22, became the youngest archwizard ever. To
gain this title, one had to create a mythallar, carve an enclave
from a mountain, erect a city upon it, and then claim it as his own.
For several months after his feat, Karsus was unable to procure
businesses and residences, primarily due to his youthfulness. He
decided that if magical might alone couldn’t attract citizens to his
enclave, perhaps an image of success would.
Karsus’s first spellcasting came at the tender age of two, when he
instinctively cast a cantra. Young Karsus found himself learning
spells almost inherently, as though he always knew them. The
local priesthood of Mystryl took an immediate interest in the
young man and trained him. They tried to indoctrinate him into
their church hierarchy, but he wasn’t interested. He didn’t believe
that putting his faith in a polytheistic structure would do him any
good-he believed himself worthy of a god’s stature. This, of
course, made him the perfect candidate for archwizardry, since
all the archwizards believed in only themselves.
