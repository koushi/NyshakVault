Kid DND notes:

Pillar room:
- Flushing sound and the water begins to drain from the room. There are 7 stones in the room. Kids must survive 2 rounds in the room. Roll a 2D8. On a 1-7 the stone with that number disappears. The room fills with a dense steam from the hot spring between rounds making it difficult to see the stones. 

Main Chamber with pond and crates
- Center pond is a bubbling hot spring with scalding hot water. The cool water from the surrounding rooms flow into the pool creating a massive cloud of steam occasionally ( d6, on a 5 or 6 visibility cut in half )

Path from entrance to main chamber
- multiple traps. 
	- arrow traps
	- trap door
	- net trap
	- boulder trap ( Indiana Jones style)
		- athletics check to run away from boulder. Failed check they are "squished" by the boulder
		- boulder crashes at the end blocking the way around the boiling pool
