Kid DND notes:

Pillar rule: floor is lava rules
- Room is quickly filling with water. There are 7 stones in the room. Kids must survive 2 rounds in the room. Roll a 2D8. On a 1-7 the stone with that number disappears. The room fills with a dense steam from the hot spring between rounds making it difficult to see the stones.
