Karsus hired some of the best architects in the land to create
buildings that defied the very laws of gravity and physics. These
structures eventually became known as some of the greatest arcanist
colleges and universities in Netheril. The uniqueness of the
structures, and the hope of having such a building for themselves,
lured people to Karsus’s enclave, and the city became successful.
As Ioulaum perfected his greatest spell, Ioulaum’s longevity,
Karsus, at the age of 22, became the youngest archwizard ever. To
gain this title, one had to create a mythallar, carve an enclave
from a mountain, erect a city upon it, and then claim it as his own.
For several months after his feat, Karsus was unable to procure
businesses and residences, primarily due to his youthfulness. He
decided that if magical might alone couldn’t attract citizens to his
enclave, perhaps an image of success would.
Karsus’s first spellcasting came at the tender age of two, when he
instinctively cast a cantra. Young Karsus found himself learning
spells almost inherently, as though he always knew them. The
local priesthood of Mystryl took an immediate interest in the
young man and trained him. They tried to indoctrinate him into
their church hierarchy, but he wasn’t interested. He didn’t believe
that putting his faith in a polytheistic structure would do him any
good-he believed himself worthy of a god’s stature. This, of
course, made him the perfect candidate for archwizardry, since
all the archwizards believed in only themselves.
Karsus
Many great arcanists were born in Netheril, and many of them
outlived their own civilization by centuries, typically by lichdom.
While many of the most powerful Netherese were archwizards, it
wasn’t necessarily a requirement. Of all those who did survive
beyond the fall of Netheril, however, none were as great as
Karsus.
The Shadowed Age of Netheril brought the first inklings of what
was to befall the Netherese—it was a time when the shadows of
doom crept around the Netherese landscape. Beginning with
Karsus’s birth in 3163, this age heralded the arrival of the phaerimm,
the birth of Olostin, and the discovery of even more powerful
magic. Its conclusion was marked by the utterance of a single
spell; Karsus’s avatar.
The Shadowed Age
Oberon, distraught over the loss of his love, moved to
Yeoman’s Loft and attempted to maintain a presence in
Realmspace. Even his death 10 years later didn’t hamper
Netheril’s presence, as others who felt and shared his dedication
continued in his wake.
This dread did nothing but separate the Netherese from the
spelljamming community already in space and made trade nearly
impossible. In fact, Netherese ships were attacked on sight.
Oberon, an arcanist born during this time in Netheril’s history,
tried his best to mend his nation’s reputation in space, but it was
to no avail. One hundred years after the first ship ventured above
Toril’s surface, Netheril recalled the last one. The tremendous
expense of armoring and defending their ships far exceeded any
profits to be made in Realmspace. Since the Netherese were
unsuccessful in creating their own helms and other spelljamming
items-being forced to rely on the Arcane for such materials—
they decided to drop out of Realmspace.
tured into Realmspace up until 2795, a very bad name and a horrid
reputation-akin to the fear generated when an illithid spelljamming
ship was seen.

In order to assure even greater success, Karsus persuaded the
council of Seventon to loan his city the remaining nether scrolls in
order to study them and see if there was a link between all the
scrolls in order to find the ones that were missing. Unfortunately,
as the scrolls were en route to Karsus, the caravan (though guarded
by over 100 warriors and arcanists) was ransacked and the
scrolls were stolen. An intense search for the thieves began in 3195
but ended seven years later in failure, with the loss of 125 lives.
Netheril now had none of the nether scrolls in its possession, and
their whereabouts perplexed even the greatest arcanists and seers.
