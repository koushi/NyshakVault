Gilmore notes

Greetings fairies, I hope you are enjoying your festivities. Happy birthday..... oh wait why can't I see them. ( Look off camera ) Good sir, I thought you said we would be able to communicate with them. How do you expect me to communicate if I can't see them? Can you hear me fairies? ( Wait a few seconds then louder with camera taps ) Oh great...well I hope you can hear this. Fairies, congratulations on a job well done.....if you were actively trying to help your enemies. I can't believe it, I really can't. Tell me ladies, what exactly are you doing? Why have you not returned the fire back to Shadowfire? ( hmmmm? ) What cat got your tongue? Well I guess that's about right, I mean you clearly don't like to reply back to letters written to you. Rude. How is it only one of you had the presence of mind to write back? Well did you get a response? ( scoff... ) Word around the wizard's guild is you are ignoring your chances to get more information. Now I put my neck on the line for you ladies and look what it got me. Scroll duty....ugh. A man with my talents being wasted on scroll duty....seriously. Whilst galavanting around your festival for spooks and spirits did it not cross your mind to ask the shop keeper for information? Did it not seem strange to see a troll there as well? Ladies, I cannot stand the spot you have put me in. I'm in danger of getting a cramp in my wrist and i've already stained my best robes with ink. Please please please......please help me. I know the "TAAAAHcos and meat patties" are delicous and all but we have information that needs gathering. You there. The good looking gentleman. Yes you! My you look very familiar.... wait what was I saying again..? Oh right, fairies maybe you ought to check out the wood. And be careful, I don't like what is happening. Ta Fairies!
