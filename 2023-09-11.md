2.The morning goes well Ny’shak is getting faster hitting all the targets Oloma presents but she senses he’s reaching his physical limit. 
1.“Ny’shak, its not about just hitting the targets. Your movements are fast but wasteful.” Oloma comments as they rest for a bit.
2.“We don’t have much time Ny’shak. In two days the trials begin if they were today you would fail. I’m sorry but that is the truth.”
3.Ny’shak’s head droops dejectedly, “Grandmother, what happens when I fail?”
4.“You won’t, I believe in you.”
5.Ny’shak looks at Oloma and asks flatly, “Grandmother?”

7.Ny’shak growls, “Who will die?”
8.Oloma doesn’t reply. Ny’shak feeling the fury and frustration building roars, “Answer me!”
9.Another brief pause. Finally Oloma replies, “Kai’sa.” Tears stream from Oloma’s eyes. “Young one, I can’t say anymore. You have to succeed. You have to protect her.”
10.Ny’shak’s mind reels as the words wash over him. A memory from the night he came to this world, a blinding bluish light and the words “Protect her,” echoing in his head. The light fades and the visage of Kai’sa appears, hand extended wiping his brow. 
11.“Ny’shak, I’m so very sorry. When the time is right I will explain what I can. I give you my word.”
3.Oloma and Ny’shak get back to training with Oloma pushing Ny’shak harder and harder but still not making any progress.
4.Ny’shak’s frustration is palpable, he begins to mutter in draconic to himself. As he paces around the pool his anger comes to a head. A gleaming blue pulse of energy shoots out as Ny’shak roars towards the waterfall, a faint black aura emanating from him.
5.“So it is true,” Oloma whispers watching Ny’shak.
10.Training escalates
