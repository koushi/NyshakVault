# Niko

Thematic:

Niko is a medium ranged fighter using a one handed Lance and shield when in defensive mode. In offensive mode the shield retracts and becomes an arm cannon. His lance is shaped like a helix that widens out to two prongs on the end. Niko uses his lance to impale enemies while keeping them out of range. During skirmishes Niko is known to throw his lance like a Javelin impaling enemies at range. When fighting ranged Niko's shield retracts turning into an arm cannon. The cannon is capable of firing energy bursts for sustained damage, and a gravity well for moving enemies closer. The energy bursts may be replaced/upgraded with different kinds of ammo such as incendiary, gravity, shock, etc. Niko's soft plasmoid body is encased in a mechanical suit of arcane power fused with engineering genius. This exosuit helps protect 

Mechanically:
One handed lance with thrown property if you will allow it. ( 1d12 for melee) tweak the dmg for thrown. I will want to infuse this with returning weapon
hand crossbow for arm cannon - ( 1d6  *60*/120) tweak the range a little - I will infuse this with repeating shot but also use special ammo as we find it. 

Gravity well is a reskinned Thorn whip that lets me move enemies 10ft which would replace the Steel defender's Force Rend ability.
