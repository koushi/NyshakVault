# Niko

Thematic:

Niko is a medium ranged fighter using a one handed Lance and shield when in defensive mode. In offensive mode the shield retracts and becomes an arm cannon. His lance is shaped like a helix that widens out to two prongs on the end. Niko uses his lance to impale enemies while keeping them out of range. During skirmishes Niko is known to throw his lance like a Javelin impaling enemies at range. When fighting ranged Niko's shield retracts turning into an arm cannon. The cannon is capable of firing energy bursts for sustained damage, and a gravity well for moving enemies closer, as well as 

Mechanically:
Lances normally are a two handed weapon unless mounted. Using the Steel defender as a mount allows me to use it one handed.
