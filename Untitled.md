# Niko

Thematic:

Niko is a medium ranged fighter using a one handed Lance and shield when in defensive mode. In offensive mode the shield retracts and becomes an arm cannon. His lance is shaped like a helix that widens out to two prongs on the end. Niko can throw the lance if needed for extra range on his attacks. 

Mechanically:
Lances normally are a two handed weapon unless mounted. Using the Steel defender as a mount allows me to use it one handed.
