Key moment for Ny'shak. He is sent on mission to assassinate a high value target. Like all of the recent Order missions, no details are given other than when and where it is to take place.   

## Details



### Background

Political unrest between the Upper Netherese pushes enclaves to engage in outright war with each other, dragging allied Lower enclaves into the conflict. 
Due to the corruption of the Order at the hands of Shar, the Order has taken a more active role acting more as an army for hire. 
This has often pitted the two sides of the order against each other.
