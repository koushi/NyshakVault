Name: Ix’aryzvaer
Race: Silver Greatwyrm

Ix’aryzvaer was a great ally to the goddess Selune in her conflict with Shar. 

Was captured and tortured by Shar for centuries.

Shar used Ix’aryzvaer’s magical powers to corrupt creatures once loyal to the dragon. Her goal was to create an army to turn the tide in her fight against Selune. 

Sensing Shar was close to completing her goal Ix’aryzvaer secretly created a half-dragon spawn mixing the power of Shar with her own draconic power. 

For many years Ix’aryzvaer was able to keep the half-dragon hidden from Shar, teaching the young half-dragon about Selune and her ideals.
