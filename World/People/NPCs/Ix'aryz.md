### Background

Ixâ€™aryz was a great ally and lover to the goddess Selune. 

Was captured and tortured by Shar for centuries. 

Ix'aryz was the original guardian of the Brands, the remenents of the vast power Selune used to strike Shar causing devestating injuries to both and also spawning the birth of Mystryl. 

Ix kept this power hidden in her hoard well beneath the Abbey of the Moon until its eventual destruction by corrupted agents of Shar.  

With the help of Selune and some Storm giants an island was created in the middle of what would now be the Plains of Standing stones. This island was protected by a massive perpetual storm allowing few ships through without invitation. 

Corrupted by Shar hoping to gain control of the Brands to destroy the leftover power from Selune while securing the power torn from her eons ago. 

Ix begins to bring people devout to Selune to the island. Over hundreds of years the island becomes a massive compound for an order dedicated to the ideals of Selune and maintaining the balance of light and dark in the world. The population of the island grows and develops into port town with a massive complex for training an army.
