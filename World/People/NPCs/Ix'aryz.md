Name: Ix’aryz
Race: Silver(Platinum?) Greatwyrm

Ix’aryz was a great ally and lover to the goddess Selune. 

Was captured and tortured by Shar for centuries. 

Ix'aryz was the original guardian of the Brands, the remenents of the vast power Selune used to strike Shar causing devestating injuries to both and also spawning the birth of Mystra. 

Ix kept this power hidden in her hoard well beneath the Abbey of the Moon until its eventual destruction by corrupted agents of Shar.
