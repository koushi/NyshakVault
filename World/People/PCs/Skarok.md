# World

In the heart of Verdanth, amidst its sprawling jungles and azure seas, stand the towering Treant gods—colossal Titans of elemental power, each reaching a staggering height of 5 kilometers. These lumbering behemoths, embodiments of the earth, air, fire, and water, cast their watchful gaze over the asteroid world, their presence a constant reminder of the ancient powers that shape its destiny.

As they move about the planet with uncanny grace, the Treant gods cast their shadows over the cities below. Yet, despite their immense size, not a brick nor wooden beam stirs as they traverse the landscape, their footsteps echoing through the forests and mountains with a solemn reverence.

In the northern reaches of Verdanth, beneath the shadow of the Treant god of Earth, lies the city of Stonewood. Here, amidst the rugged mountains and ancient forests, the noble clans of the north gather beneath the watchful gaze of their towering guardian, their halls standing firm against the passage of time.

To the east, where the Treant god of Air holds sway, stands the city of Skyhaven. Perched high atop the swaying branches of colossal trees, Skyhaven is a city of ethereal beauty and grace, its spires reaching skyward in homage to the elemental power that surrounds it.

In the south, amidst the fiery peaks of volcanic mountains, lies the city of Emberforge, beneath the fiery gaze of the Treant god of Fire. Here, amidst the searing heat and choking ash, the noble clans of the south forge their destiny, their resolve tempered by the flames of creation.

Finally, in the west, where the Treant god of Water reigns supreme, stands the city of Tideholm. Built upon the tranquil shores of azure seas and hidden within the depths of shimmering lakes, Tideholm is a city of serene beauty and quiet contemplation, its reflection shimmering upon the surface of the water as the Treant god's gentle touch caresses its shores.

In each of these cities, the influence of the Treant gods is palpable, their elemental power shaping the very essence of Verdanth itself. And as they move about the planet with uncanny grace, their presence serves as a reminder of the ancient forces that bind the world together, guiding its inhabitants on their journey through the swirling currents of fate.

## History

Once upon a time, amidst the vast expanse of wildspace, there existed a celestial jewel known as Verdanth—an asteroid world of unparalleled beauty and untamed wilderness. From its sprawling jungles to its azure seas, Verdanth was a realm teeming with life and wonder, its secrets shrouded in the mists of time.

In the age of antiquity, before the memory of mortals, the treant gods—colossal Titans of elemental power—walked the surface of Verdanth, their towering forms casting shadows over the land. From the treant god of Earth, whose roots stretched deep into the heart of the asteroid, to the treant god of Air, whose lofty branches reached for the heavens, these ancient beings watched over Verdanth with solemn vigilance.

Yet, amidst the majesty of the treant gods, Verdanth was a world divided. Noble clans, each pledging allegiance to one of the elemental treants, vied for supremacy amidst the verdant expanse. Wars were fought, alliances forged, and kingdoms rose and fell in the endless cycle of conflict and conquest.

It was in this turbulent era that a figure emerged—a warlord of unparalleled cunning and ambition. Known as Jirak, this formidable leader sought to unite the fractured lands of Verdanth under a single banner. With strategic brilliance and unwavering resolve, Jirak waged wars and brokered alliances, his vision of unity guiding him ever forward.

Under Jirak's rule, Verdanth entered a golden age of prosperity and peace. The asteroid world flourished, its cities thriving amidst the verdant jungles and azure seas.

In the twilight of his life, as Jirak lay upon his deathbed, he gathered the heads of the four major clans—the pillars of Verdanthese society. With his last breaths, he spoke of a vision that had come to him—a vision of the Verdanthese expanding beyond the confines of their asteroid world and venturing into the uncharted depths of wildspace.

Moved by Jirak's words and inspired by his vision, the lords of the great clans convened a council to discuss the possibilities that lay before them. They spoke of exploration and adventure, of new lands to discover and untold riches to claim. And so, with the blessings of the council, the champions of each clan were chosen to lead an expedition into the unknown, accompanied by their most trusted allies and supporters.

As the expedition ventured deeper into wildspace, they encountered an Astral Path raiding vessel—a stark reminder of the dangers that lurked beyond the boundaries of Verdanth. A fierce battle ensued, with both sides suffering heavy losses in the chaotic fray. Yet, amidst the bloodshed and chaos, a moment of clarity emerged—a mutual recognition of the futility of continued conflict.

In the aftermath of the battle, a truce was called, and emissaries from both sides came together to negotiate a treaty of trade and cooperation. The Verdanthese clans, recognizing the potential benefits of collaboration with the Astral Path, agreed to allow them to establish a trading port on an isolated island, far removed from the heart of Verdanthese society.

### Backstory

In the depths of Stonewood, where the towering canopies cast shadows over the humble homes of the lowest caste, there dwelled a bugbear named Skarok. Born and raised in an area known as the Undergrowth, Skarok's days were spent honing his skills as both a hunter and a chef. His family operated a modest butcher shop, offering prime cuts of meat from Skarok's expertly executed hunts.

While the quality of the meat drew some customers, it was Skarok's culinary creations that truly captured the hearts and taste buds of those who crossed the threshold of his family's establishment. With a deft touch and a keen eye for flavor, Skarok transformed the simplest of ingredients into gastronomic masterpieces, each dish a testament to his skill and passion.

But for Skarok, the thrill of the hunt and the satisfaction of creating culinary delights were reward enough. He cared little for fame or recognition, content to ply his trade in the humble surroundings of the Undergrowth. However, fate had other plans for the gifted bugbear.

As word of Skarok's talents spread, he found himself thrust into the spotlight, cooking meals for bugbears of higher stations, including the lords of the great clans. It was during these encounters that Skarok first heard tales of the Astral Path—an enigmatic organization that traversed the cosmos in search of adventure and discovery.

Listening with rapt attention as the members of the Astral Path regaled him with stories of unimaginable worlds and exotic beasts, Skarok's heart swelled with longing. For amidst the hustle and bustle of Stonewood, he yearned for the freedom of the stars, where he could hunt amongst the cosmic expanse and explore the mysteries of the universe.

And so, as he tended to his duties in the butcher shop, Skarok dreamed of the day when he would embark on his own journey into the unknown, armed with nothing but his skills as a hunter, a chef, and an insatiable thirst for adventure. For amidst the swirling currents of fate, Skarok knew that his destiny awaited him among the stars, where the call of the hunt and the promise of culinary spoils beckoned him ever onward.


### Campaign

So the Unifying of Jirak and the following call to expanse and expedition into the wider Astra Sea surrounding Verdanth is fantastic. Their meeting with the Astral Path and the cooperation done there will work perfect. In these days, the Astral Path was a small coalition of sentients of elevated technology, i.e. Jammers. and the ability to traverse the cerebral expanse that is the Astral Sea. They brought secrets and spices, knowledge and devices to enrich the already burgeoning civilizations of Verdanth. They even offered to guide the Verdanthese peoples into the muddy mental map of the Astral Sea. And they did. Working together the optimistic paring of the Astral Path and the Verdanthese allowed and encouraged an exodus of the Verdanthese into the Astral Sea. Skarok was among one of these exoduses. Being chosen from Jirak's faithful, Itl, Clan leader of the Stonewood's top Clans, personally invited Skarok on an expodition to a planet called 'Toril' which was known to be famous for it's varied foodstuffs and rich cultures. And Skarok knew that culture meant food, and often unique foods. His wanderlust aided in his decision, effectively cutting out any second thoughts. Not even to mention the incredible creatures that could be hunted there. Itl knew of Skarok's love for exploration and shared the urge to hunt. But time had rent their lives apart. Skarok was ostrasized and Itl was thrust into the Upper Echelons of his caste. So Skarok was surprised when he received such an invitation, signed by an old friend he'd thought had long forgotten him.
