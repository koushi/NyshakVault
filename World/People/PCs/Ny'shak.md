## Biography
### Background
#### Birth?

Ny'shak was born from pure darkness, an unholy union of the corrupting power of Shar and the indominable spirit of his Great Wyrm [[Ix'aryz|sire]]. Ny'shak's earliest memories are nothing more than pitch black darkness, the sounds of something following him and the [[Birth|salvation]] of moonlight. 

Ny'shak awoke in a clearing gleaming with the light of glowing blue flowers blossoming in the moonlight. With the words of Selune, "Protect her!", booming is his head his blurred vision clears as his eyes meet the aquamarine eyes of the young girl with feline features, [[Kai'sa]]. From that moment a sacred bond was formed, as long as he lived he would protect her. Kai'sa [[Rebirth|nurses]] him back to health. 

#### Childhood
One day as Kai'sa and Ny'shak are talking she is bullied by 3 youths,[[Tovius]], and his cousins. Ny'shak is [[Rebirth 2.2|beaten handily]] by the youths as he attempts to protect the girl. Months go by without incident while Ny'shak spends his time learning about the [[Island|area]] around him. Ny'shak sees Kai'sa get knocked out with a viscous kick from Tovius while watching her at school from the distance. Filled with [[The Silence|an insatiable fury]], Ny'shak stalks Tovius for days before ambushing him. Once the ambush was sprung Ny'shak unleashed a brutal mauling on Tovius nearly [[Rebirth 2.3|killing the boy]]. Kai'sa sensing something was wrong found the half-dragon and stopped him before it was too late. Kai'sa screams at him to leave eyes filled with terror. Ny'shak fled to the surrounding jungle returning the grove that evening hoping to find the girl again.  

Later that evening the girl returned, but not alone. Accompanying her was [[Oloma|an older woman]] her grandmother. She spent the evening explaining the beliefs of her [[village]] which center around Selune and the balance of light and dark. Ny'shak realizes the teachings of Oloma and Ix are very similar. Time passes as Ny'shak and Kai'sa become inseparable. When she is not at school studying martial arts with the other children, she was with Ny'shak roaming the island they call home. 

#### Adolescence ( 10 years old )
After the incident with Tovius, Ny'shak was taken in by Kai'sa, Oloma and her family. Ny'shak was given work at the smith shop in town. [[The smith]] was kind but stern with Ny'shak in comparison to the rest of [[Needs better name|town]]. Ny'shak began to show his talent for learning quickly. Within a few months Ny'shak moved from menial tasks to helping with the smithing. Ny'shak's experiences in town found him shunned and discriminated against for his looks and inability to speak Netherese but mostly for his draconic looks.

Life continued in this fashion until Kai'sa was accepted into [[the Order]]. When Ny'shak wasn't manning the forge, he was watching the training in the massive complex that made up most of the port city. The pattern of movements mesmerized him as acolytes ran through kata after kata. After school and far into the evening Kai'sa would describe the Order and her dreams to join the ranks few have ever reached in the upper echelons, [[the Echoes of Fate]]. Kai'sa would excitedly show Ny'shak what she was learning even when she barely understood it herself.

Kai'sa's passion and joy slowly faded as Tovius and the others relentlessly [[Kai'sa#bullying|bully her]]. The oath sworn to protect the girl roared deep within him. Shadows of his defeat at the hands of Tovius danced across the floor. Kai'sa finds herself struggling to keep up with the lessons for reasons related to her condition. Kai'sa is one of the few they call [[moontouched]], those able to use [[the Brands]] naturally. Her struggles draw the ire of her sensei her Uncle Sadir, Tovius' father. Ny'shak vows to help Kai'sa master her training. Ny'shak begins to observe the acolytes in the compound with a renewed intensity, committing every movement to memory. He begins secretly practicing the movements in [[a secluded area]] of the jungle. He realizes the forms are all based on the animals and creatures the two spent their time chasing as youths. Ny'shak asks Kai'sa to show him what she has learn so they can practice together. Soon Ny'shak surpasses Kai'sa and begins to tutor her correcting her forms. Kai'sa goes from being the ridiculed to top of the class. Kai'sa pleads to her uncle to let Ny'shak join the Order vouching for him. Ny'shak repeatedly is denied. Sadir does not trust Ny'shak for what he did to Tovius. He finally relents when Kai'sa explains he was the one helping her improve so quickly. A meeting is arranged in the jungle away from town in order to maintain Sadir and the order's reputation. 

[[Event rumble in the jungle|Sadir meets Ny'shak]] and Kai'sa late in the evening. He instructs Ny'shak to attack him who hesitates to move but is encouraged by Kai'sa. Sadir easily counters everything Ny'shak throws at him and insults Kai'sa calling Ny'shak nothing more than a savage beast. Ny'shak stands up eyes changing to a reddish purple color feeling the fury once again building inside. They spar back and forth with Ny'shak copying techniques used against him getting closer and closer to connecting on Sadir. With each wave the fury grows inside Ny'shak while his eyes shift deeper and deeper towards crimson. A faint black aura begins emanating from Ny'shak. Sadir notices the aura and realizes Ny'shak won't stop coming. Before Ny'shak can launch another attack Sadir stuns Ny'shak in place agreeing to accept him into the academy but warns him it won't be easy since no one will be there to interpret for him. Ny'shak asks Sadir when do they start in heavily accented Netherese shocking both Kai'sa and her uncle before collapsing in exhaustion.

For the next 2 years, Ny'shak trains with the Order quickly mastering the katas, forms and movements drawing the ire of Tovius and his cohorts. But he soon found himself to be the one struggling. Training shifted from the academy to the mountain paths inside [[the Monastery]]. The acolytes spent months honing their spiritual and physical minds with task pushing their bodies to the limits and beyond by focusing their ki. Ny'shak pushes through the training only managing to pass some of the task through brute force alone. 


##### Details still in progress

Training, and formation of the Eyes. 

Adventures with the Eyes for years. Hoping to become Echoes. 

The Phaerim awaken ( -461 DR ) drawn by the Netherese. The island is found due to drained magic by the arcanists, Karsus, Shade and the leader of the order cut a deal to stay hidden. The order begins to fragment missions undertaken by the Order of Shadow become less about balance. 
 
The dance, and the connection. Ny'shak and Kai'sa fully manifest the Brands.

Ny'shak and Kai'sa join the Echoes along with other members of the Eyes.  

hundreds of years pass ( go magic doping ) as The Echoes begin 

Ny'shak sent to [[Betrayal|kill Kai'sa]] but doesn't go through with it. Goes on the run with Kai'sa for years gathering allies to stop the Order. Reconnects with the Eyes. Base of operations moves to Opus one of the floating cities of Netheril. It becomes clear that the order has been compromised but to what extent is unknown. A civil war breaks out within the Order as both sides try to gather allies. The truth of [[The Monster|Ny'shak's origin]] and the Brands is revealed to the Eyes by Oloma who is revealed to be Selune to the others. 

With great sadness Selune decides the Order cannot go on in its current form and tasks the Eyes and any allies they can gather to stop them. Ny'shak and Kai'sa approach Oloma worried for their grandmother. Oloma tells them for the first time she is unable to see what will happen. She mentions the threads of fate all being pulled towards a critical nexus and worries which way it will go. 

Ny'shak The Eyes leave Opus heading out to gather information, allies and supplies for whatever they were walking into. 

Kai'sa is captured and imprisoned in the Monastery. Ny'shak and his allies assault the Monastery to free Kai'sa. They are able to breach the gate and take the courtyard but fighting grinds to a standstill. Members of the order still loyal to Selune are confused as to what is happening and why Ny'shak returned. They all believe he turned on Kai'sa like he did Tovius in his youth. Kai'sa and Ny'shak declare a challenge for [[Puppet leader|Ix]] for control of the Order. Ny'shak and Kai'sa approach the massive gate inside a dragon's skull. Summoning their Brands they unlock the portal and step into [[the prison]]. 

Ny'shak and Kai'sa fight and flee their way to the exit through a nightmarish world of [[The Council|fallen allies]] imprisoned inside. They emerge from the prison onto a plateau where the Brands are located. Hovering far above are two of the floating enclaves one of Karsus, defacto leader of the Netherese, and his ally Lord Shadow, now minion of Shar. The Eyes arrive shortly after. Knowing they don't have much time they prepare to teleport back to Opus while Ny'shak and Kai'sa deal with the Brands. More to come....

As the teleport circle is completing, Ny'shak pushes Kai'sa towards the circle out of sight and turns around to stop the advance of the pursuing arcanists and their guard. Ny'shak is confronted by Tovius and his cohorts flanked by Karsus and Lord Shadow. Kai'sa screams for Ny'shak to run as the members of the Eyes hold her back from trying to join. Ny'shak promises Kai'sa he will meet her in Opus and addresses Tovius. Tovius growls back still bitter about not getting to fight Ny'shak all those years ago. He claims Ny'shak stole his birthright that he was the shadowed touched Shar promised his family eons ago. He would be the one to return the Brands to Shar and destroy Selune starting with Ny'shak then Kai'sa. Brimming with raw magic from the Brands Ny'shak asks if that's what he really wants. Tovius brandishes [[corrupted brand|an unholy aura]] of his own. The two trade blows in an [[Tovius vs Ny'shak|epic battle]]. Ny'shak quickly gains the upper hand before the other 3 join in. It is around this time Tovius and the arcanists realize Ny'shak is stalling. Ny'shak begins singing, casting silence on the arcanists ensuring Kai'sa's escape. Through their connection Kai'sa forces Ny'shak to swear on his soul he will come to Opus. He replies stating as long as her moonlight shines he will be there to protect her. She quips, "Better hurry" casting haste as she feels the connection in her soul stretched as the teleport completes. 

The battle continues between Tovius and Ny'shak. Through speed and precision Ny'shak controls the battle field leaving little to exploit by their numbers. The fight is cut short when a group of phaerim drawn by the two massive enclaves hovering above attack the Monastery. Karsus calls for Tovius to stop holding Ny'shak in place magically. Tovius refuses pressing [[Tovius's deal|the promise]] made for leading them here. Karsus reminds Tovius they aren't here for revenge but to save Netheril. He looks at Ny'shak stating Ny'shak has something he needs. Without hesitation Karsus waves his hands speaks the incantation as the Greatwyrm spines are [[lost spines|ripped]] from Ny'shaks body. Karsus, and Lord Shadow turn to leave. Tovius hesitates to leave looking toward the dying half-dragon. Tovius makes sure Ny'shak lives telling the dragon their fight isn't finished. Then follows Lord Shadow back to his enclave. 

Ny'shak wakes up descends the mountain with the body of Ix through the portal. He throws the corpse down roaring. Fighting rages all around him as the those of the Order still alive attempt to protect the Monastery. The fight quickly degrades from combat to survival. The Sharn and phaerim trade spells leaving cataclysmic results in their wake. The once majestic mountain peak reduced to gravel, a lust jungle withered to dust in the blink of an eye. The battle is won, and the cost is great. The Order is decimated left without direction. 

Ny'shak is looked to for leadership but he refuses that mantle. Still barely recovered from the fight he interrogates survivors where to find Opus. With his connection to Kai'sa acting as a compass, he wanders out into the newly formed desert searching for his destination. Ny'shak comes across the Storm Giant allies whose ancestors helped hide the island Monastery and [[The Shattered Tower|their floating castle]]. Ny'shak begs for passage to Opus or at least one of the other archwizards enclaves. They agree to help Ny'shak but will not put themselves in danger to do so. 

Ny'shak boards the palace as they head southeast towards. He spends his days tracking enclaves on the horizon hoping to find Opus. With each passing day the unease grows, Ny'shak begins to hear [[The Monster|a faint voice]] in his head. It rambles on and on about Shar and the archwizards trying to kill them.  Ny'shak initially tries to shake it off and ignore it thinking it isn't real but the voice continues this time addressing Ny'shak by name. The voice pleads to Ny'shak to set it free promising vengeance against those that harmed him. The mention of vengeance triggers flashbacks of the past few days
