The young Eladrin (High Elf) Gawain (pronounced Gavain) was born to a family of Elven courtiers whose roles it was to offer comfort to other Eladrin nobles. A high station among Feywild kingdoms, debaucherious and sensual as they can be. Though an at times feared one, as such courtiers are always in a position for potential espionage or assassination.

While it is said all Elves of the Fairie realm can recall a time when the light of Arvandor and their gods once shone upon their souls, Gawain was a unique soul. Having recalled it most keenly, and never quite feeling at home in the feywild.

Adventurous as he grew to be, he became a talented adventurer in addition to a beloved courtier. Specifically skilled in stealth techniques, often running off to dark woods where few would dare tread. Earning him the nickname Man of Smoke.

One day, he stumbled upon a powerful Hag named Sc치thach (pronounced skahah), who surely would have eaten him. But he managed to trick her into a trap. For her freedom, he demanded she share her secrets. Hags are infamous for their secrets after all. This resulted in her taking him in as a student for a time. Making a skilled warrior of him too.

So Gawain trained under the Hag, along with a second young elven man named Setanta.
Setanta was a prodigy warrior already in service to an Elven lord named Culann, having earned the nickname Lord Culann's Hound. Setanta was not the smartest though, and was tricked into seeking the secrets of the Hag Scathach in order to earn the hand of an elven lady he loved. It was only thanks to Gawain's cunning that Setanta was not killed and eaten by the Hag.

Training together, the two bonded close. Ya know, in that Achilles/Patroclus blood brother/lover "what a crazy summer that was" kinda way. After their training, Gawain was given a magic mantle made of some mythical creature's horn skin. While Setanta was given a spear from the Shadow realms. They parted ways, assuming they would never meet again.


So that was young Gavin. You might call it his awakening. He was now a warrior, an adventurer, and knew his way around various kinds of meats and peaches


Sadly, after he fell into the service of a most frightening lady. Queen Mab, the Unseelie Queen of Winter court. The Lady of Darkness and Air. Never was there a truer symbol of the fey people's debauchery and cruelty. And as a must clever and skilled courtier, Gawain became her most favored assassin.


It was a shadowy existence, but one he thrived in. He never had reason to question his work until one unfortunate day.

An Elven Kingdom named Ulster had just survived an invasion of Demons from the Abyss. Winning only because they succeeded in capturing the demon's greatest weapon. A terrifying bull monster which the Ulster king now planned to leverage against the other Elven kingdoms.

Quenn Mab instantly sought to make the Bull her's. Sending her armies against the Ulster men. Weakened as they were, many cursed by Demonic magics, only one Ulster warrior stood against her armies. Stood and won.


Whoever this man was, he could not be beaten in one on one combat. So Queen Mab conspired to have him beaten and one on one "combat"

So she called for Ferdia, the Man of Smoke. Her Gawain. And sent him against the Ulster warrior. But what Gavin found was Setanta. Grown and mighty.

He tried to convince Setanta this wasn't worth dying over. But the man wouldnt listen. He was stubborn to a fault, as Gavin knew well. They fought, and Gavin indeed had the upper hand. But he couldn't bring himself to kill his Setanta. So instead, he took a dive. Allowed himself to be struck by his blood brother's magic spear. Allowed himself to die.

When he awoke upon the battlefield, an unclear time later, his life preserved by his now tattered magic cloak, the war was done.

The Hound of Culann would hold Queen Mab's forces at bay. Only to be tricked into a curse some time after. He would died standing up with 3 magic spears run through him.
Mab would have her Bull, but the Bull was broken. It no longer knew any anger or ambition. Disappearing into history. Gavin having never seen the creature himself.


His world seemingly destroyed around him. Gavin would follow suit. Sick of the feywild and its lack of honor. His own lack of honor. And escaping into the prime material

He would become Gavin the Whore. Ever prideful of himself and his race when surrounding my the lesser races. Yet deep down still conflicted on what it means to be an elf or fey.







Gawain's Internal Conflict:

Feywild vs. Mortality: Gawain's unique connection to Arvandor grants him a perspective that sets him apart from other Feywild inhabitants. This disconnect leads to a profound internal conflict as he navigates the debaucherous and often cruel nature of the Feywild.
Honor vs. Duty: As a skilled assassin serving Queen Mab, Gawain faces a constant struggle between his personal honor and his duty to his queen. His decision to spare Setanta's life highlights this internal conflict and foreshadows his eventual disillusionment.
The Significance of Setanta:

Brotherly Bond: The deep bond between Gawain and Setanta is a central element of the story. Their shared experiences and unwavering loyalty create a powerful connection that ultimately leads to Gawain's tragic sacrifice.
Symbol of Hope: Setanta represents a purer, more noble aspect of the Feywild. His unwavering courage and dedication to his people provide a stark contrast to the corruption and cruelty that surround Gawain.
Queen Mab's Role:

Villainous Force: Queen Mab serves as a formidable antagonist, embodying the worst aspects of the Feywild. Her ruthless pursuit of power and her willingness to manipulate others create a compelling villainous figure.
Test of Character: Queen Mab's demands on Gawain serve as a test of his loyalty and his ability to navigate the morally ambiguous world of the Feywild.
Thematic Exploration:

The Nature of Good and Evil: The story explores the complexities of good and evil, particularly within the context of the Feywild. Gawain's internal struggle and his ultimate sacrifice highlight the gray areas that exist between these two forces.
The Consequences of War: The Ulster War serves as a backdrop for the story, exploring the devastating consequences of conflict and the sacrifices that individuals must make in the face of war.
The Power of Friendship: The bond between Gawain and Setanta underscores the importance of friendship and loyalty, even in the face of adversity.
Potential Story Expansions:

Gawain's Time with Sc치thach: The story could delve deeper into Gawain's training with Sc치thach, exploring the challenges he faced and the lessons he learned during this time.
Queen Mab's Backstory: Exploring Queen Mab's origins and motivations could provide additional context for her actions and her influence over the Feywild.
Gawain's Future: The story could conclude with a glimpse into Gawain's life in the Prime Material Plane, exploring his struggles to adapt to a new world and the impact of his experiences in the Feywild.



Gawain's fear of regaining his lost power could stem from several reasons:

The Dark Side of Power: His experiences with Queen Mab and the corrupting influence of the Feywild might have made him wary of the potential for power to lead to cruelty and manipulation.
Loss of Innocence: Regaining his power could mean returning to a life of violence and intrigue, a path he may have come to regret after his experiences with Setanta and the Ulster War.
Fear of Failure: If he were to regain his power and fail to use it wisely, he might fear the consequences of his mistakes.
The Illusion of Peace: His current state of relative peace and anonymity might seem preferable to the potential dangers and responsibilities that come with power.
Haunted by the Past: His memories of his time as Queen Mab's assassin could haunt him, making him hesitant to embrace a similar role again.
Ultimately, Gawain's fear of regaining his lost power is likely rooted in a combination of these factors, reflecting his complex internal struggles and the challenges he faces in reconciling his past with his future.


He possesses a magic mantle made of some mythical creature's horn skin, which has the power to preserve his life. This is evident when he survives the battle against Setanta, despite being struck by his blood brother's magic spear. The mantle's protective properties likely play a significant role in Gawain's survival and his subsequent journey into the Prime Material Plane.
