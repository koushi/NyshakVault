Valen still holed up in his room. 

Skarok, Tinman and Szar share a talk and inspect the dead drop.

Valen finally comes out and starts issue orders to Miken and the recruits. 
- begins to individually interview the crew for his report
	- He tells Szar that he and Szar are similar.
	- Talks to tinman and confronts him about his sales mode.
		- Skarok stalks him on his way to Valen.
			- remains hidden until Valen puts his hand on his weapon
	- throws Skarok under the bus in his report


*Set scene
Skarok is pissed. Feels his original assessment of Valen was correct and feels foolish to think he was any different*

Next episode, Skarok will have Valen approach him in the kitchen. 
- butchering an animal - something feline with pointed ears
- make a point to talk about how individually the beast is a minimal threat, but all together the beast is a fearsome foe
- Skarok will keep his back to Valen showing him the massive bite mark and claw marks one of its kind nearly felled him with
	- recount the story
	- small team of hunters sent out to bring down one ( toragah ) managed to isolate one from the pack or so they thought. 
	- The trap was sprung on the toraga who alerted the nearby pack. 
	- A frantic escape that saw Skarok badly wounded but the hunters stuck together ensuring they all survived.

Points to make:

- Is it standard protocol for the "commander" to leave behind his team
- who put him in command, and what qualifications does he have that determined so

- If Valen panics: Finch - chilli milli chorus
	- Something Itl said to Skarok after his brother's death
