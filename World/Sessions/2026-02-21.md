they are performing a song about a giant tragedy
	- A prince about to be killed for not destroying his enemies

interesting, the theme of the song

Dilyse introduces us claiming our right to be at the gathering.

The guards just about rounded on us, but serissa staved them off saying we will speak later.

Crippy starts communing with the dark side again. 
	- Possibly preparing for a fight.

On the way out to the feast I was transported to another plane with a half-dragon.
	- Claims his daughter was Ix.
	- My grandfather. 
		- mentions the world doesn't need another greatwyrm, their is one.
