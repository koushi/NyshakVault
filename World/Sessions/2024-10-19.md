Crippy 


Feel a thread in my hand. 
	- Grandmother puts the thread in my hand

The voice callling to crippy
- Dear forgotten nephew come back to me

7 point crown of stars

you don't flee me child of vaprak
- looking for a hammer

giant earthquake
- obsidian gargoyles
	- maybe the blue dragon has something to do with this

Giant Wight speaks to us but Jack in particular
