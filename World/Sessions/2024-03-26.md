# World

In the heart of Verdanth, amidst its sprawling jungles and azure seas, stand the towering Treant godsâ€”colossal Titans of elemental power, each reaching a staggering height of 5 kilometers. These lumbering behemoths, embodiments of the earth, air, fire, and water, cast their watchful gaze over the asteroid world, their presence a constant reminder of the ancient powers that shape its destiny.

As they move about the planet with uncanny grace, the Treant gods cast their shadows over the cities below. Yet, despite their immense size, not a brick nor wooden beam stirs as they traverse the landscape, their footsteps echoing through the forests and mountains with a solemn reverence.

In the northern reaches of Verdanth, beneath the shadow of the Treant god of Earth, lies the city of Stonewood. Here, amidst the rugged mountains and ancient forests, the noble clans of the north gather beneath the watchful gaze of their towering guardian, their halls standing firm against the passage of time.

To the east, where the Treant god of Air holds sway, stands the city of Skyhaven. Perched high atop the swaying branches of colossal trees, Skyhaven is a city of ethereal beauty and grace, its spires reaching skyward in homage to the elemental power that surrounds it.

In the south, amidst the fiery peaks of volcanic mountains, lies the city of Emberforge, beneath the fiery gaze of the Treant god of Fire. Here, amidst the searing heat and choking ash, the noble clans of the south forge their destiny, their resolve tempered by the flames of creation.

Finally, in the west, where the Treant god of Water reigns supreme, stands the city of Tideholm. Built upon the tranquil shores of azure seas and hidden within the depths of shimmering lakes, Tideholm is a city of serene beauty and quiet contemplation, its reflection shimmering upon the surface of the water as the Treant god's gentle touch caresses its shores.

In each of these cities, the influence of the Treant gods is palpable, their elemental power shaping the very essence of Verdanth itself. And as they move about the planet with uncanny grace, their presence serves as a reminder of the ancient forces that bind the world together, guiding its inhabitants on their journey through the swirling currents of fate.
