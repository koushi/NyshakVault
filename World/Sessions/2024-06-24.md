Flying towards the asteroid field. 

Take the ship dark, we go under the ship preparing to board.
Tinman jumps off and climbs aboard.
	- searches the deck and breaks into the captain's quarters
	- finds an ornate musket

Szar rips a hole in the ship with his buzz saw bike, causing gravity to flip.

Fight continues on board. Niko impales the captain with the boarding spikes. 
Valen makes it onto the ship fighting the giff on deck. 

Niko binds the giff to the deck with Booming Blade. 
Valen fires his flame thrower like a rocket launcher causing the cannon balls to explode. 

Niko goes unconscious.
