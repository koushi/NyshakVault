Jack reveals himself.
- he is not your typical warforged.
- covered in cloth tabard
	- holographic but not reflective
	- abnormally lanky
	- furlike wires,


Manticore inside the iron flask.

Koz and Hati have a moment. 
	- Hati reflects back to puphood and pushes bones towards him.

*Crippy flashback*
Takes place in the fiendish planes
	- bloodwar
	- skulls of devils under his feet
	- demons don't have missions, but Crippy does
	- Crippy campaigned from the Abyss to the Hells
		- demon general
	- off in the distance, a giant city of iron. The city is prisoner itself?

Terrible beast in the city - "possibly another minotaur"

Lawful Hells
	- Devils prime enemy to Demons


*Camp activities*

Jack fixes his armor. A master craftsman at work. 
	- Koz, Gavin and I remark at his skill

Dilyse's book has an abberant magic about it.
	- his book is a mimic

We decided to float the boulder down the river in a row boat supplied by Jack.

Koz rage rows the boat. 

Crippy and Jack can't keep up.

Deep in the 2nd layer of the nine hells
	- Dix
	- The city of Iron
	- the lord of the second, advisor to the prince of devils
	- Garden of delights holds back the demon flood
	- Gates protected by ancient beast of blood and flesh
	- No mere mortal will stumble their way to the Hells on their own

Crippy asks Dilyse what he sucked off him.
	- or sucked him off??
