Still in Neverwinter. 

We are at Quality, meeting with Mother Wyrm. 

Possible Eyes of the Evening Oath:

**Oath of the Eyes**  
We are the Eyes of Evening.  
In darkness, we wait — not idle, but watching.  
We stalk the dark with teeth bared.  
By Selûne’s grace, we are fury held fast.  
We strike without warning, without mercy.  
Those who hunt the helpless become the hunted.

**Response:**  
**The night is not hers.**

Another Variant:

**Oath of the Eyes**  
We are the Eyes of Evening.  
We hunt what lurks and drag it into the light.  
We offer no warnings. We leave no survivors.  
By Selûne’s grace, we are the end unseen.  
We tear through shadow with fang and will.  
We protect our own — and bury the rest.

**Response:**  
**The night is not hers.**

**Oath of the Eyes** _(Pre-Hunt Invocation)_  
We are the Eyes of Evening.  
We hunt what hides and bleeds what preys.  
We strike first — and last.  
By Selûne’s grace, we are the blade in the dark.  
We do not warn. We do not beg.  
We leave no monsters behind.

**All (together):**  
**The night is not hers.**

Deep eyes. Wandering eye as Gavin likes to say
