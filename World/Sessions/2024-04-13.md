#Kobolds
Hadrew - leader ( but not really ) eloquint in draconic
avna  - quiet, self-assured, knowledgeable, speaks when spoken too
gigi - timid, avoids trouble, caring 
zeg - classic kobold, speaks common and doesnt like orders

Outside of orlbar, city is dark.
 Debris scattered around as if a large storm tore through it. 

Jack notices roof caved in. 
Spots a giant figure.

Long rest completed with no issues during watch. There seems to be a lack of nature and life in this area.
