So Niko's activities leading up to him reaching the Belt. Bladar, of course, recruited you at the Crate & Tackle but had to leave you for a time. She later explained that she had to check in with some of her comrades in order to fold you into what they're doing. Eventually finding you after your flight from the Crate & Tackle, they explain that having someone of your talents with them could be crucial to their efforts. Bladar seems to want to explain things in more detail, but Kanadex (a tall, middle-aged Minotaur with a curling goat-like beard) cuts her off. Kanadex isn't an unkind person, but you can see paranoia in his eyes and how he moves, Always tense, always ready for something. And to effect, as he often seems to sense things before they happen. Such as him knowing how long you have to talk during a visit to a tavern before the barmaid comes over to ask about drink orders. It's clear whatever his charge is weighs on him, and in smalls ways he's grateful for those who choose to share his burden. Him and Bladar have history carrying this burden and you can see how they trust each other. Over the couple years you've been free, and your time with them, you've learned a lot about the Belt. Some customs, locations, where the _actual_ best bars and dives are. Even spent time in some safehouses set aside by whatever group Kanadex and Bladar belong to. It's not until a couple of weeks before you meet the party that they finally open up some. Kanadex explains that your paths must diverge, that you _must_ travel to Bral. Duty takes him and Bladar in separate directions as well. He hands you a coin and says "If the undertow shall take you, break that coin in half and fate will change." They do explain a few things though, but it's clear Kanadex is hesitant still.

Firstly, you must seek out the Lustres. Of which there are five. Planar mirrors that reflect the realities of other demi-planes. They must eventually be taken to a place called "The Lighthouse" and to, what Kanadex refers to as "Your creator". Secondly, be wary of those who hide behind masks. Whispers on lips unseen are the blades that undercut the people and their will. Thirdly, in your search for the Lustre, seek those who see the lights between. Those with eyes beyond eyes and insight beyond insight. Lastly, do not fight the tides of your journey. Trust in yourself and those who trust in you. Bladar offers her own advice. "If someone means to stab you, stab them first." Something about the way they treat you though seems to be a mix of over-protection, reverence, and uncertainty. Like an individual without children asked to watch the child of a friend. But as you continued to travel things grew comfortable. Even Kanadex's unwillingness to bend eased some. Much of your journey was spent talking to the poor and old, searching for details among muddied minds. Your passage however left few ripples and you kept only memories. One evening though, as you were sitting with Kanadex in a dark corner of a tavern waiting for Bladar to return from gathering some information, the petina of drunkeness seemed to settle on the minotaur. Odd since he rarely drank. Hell, he rarely consumed anything that you could tell, outside of his own conjured food and water. "The Belt is changing Niko. And you're at the forefront, a spearhead in the heart of the encroaching darkness. You've been altered from what you originally were, but that gives you an immense power against the things that seek to consume us. Trust in the small folk, see them, hear them Niko. Give yourself to them, in pieces. You'll find answers, and your father. Of that, I'm certain." His eyes never meet yours, instead focused on a coin spinning on the table which you're certain wasn't there a moment ago.

You come to the Rock of Bral on Bladar's spelljammer, a ship you've become familiar with. An Esthetic you've been travelling aboard for some time. A small jellyfish-like ship that's run by Bladar herself, and has little room for more than a few individuals to fit comfortably. She speaks to the ship affectionately and it seems to have some level of sentience about it. She states that it's chosen name is Octis. In a brief goodbye you're set upon this place to search for the Lustre Kanadex is certain will be there. With a gold coin in your pocket, handed to you by Kanadex himself (the portent coin I gave you), and the hopes of your new friends you venture forth alone. It's worth noting that Kanadex and Bladar to admit that they are from The Waterbearer's Union and while they act in the interests of the union, the union itself lacks any real authority and offers few perks. It's a union of faith and belief that the Belt can be made better and can co-exist with the Astral Sea and it's inhabitants. It's an organization of individual agents who all seek their similar goal. Bladar's parting gift to you is a square piece of metal with a stamped symbol. A hunched individual carrying two buckets balanced on a long stick over their shoulders. One bucket contains five spheres. The other contains two, and they are in balance. She tells you to keep this tucked away and only show it to those you _truly_ trust. There are those who would see the Waterbearer Union and it's ancient duty as inconvenient at best, and a real obstacle to their ambitions at worst.

1. Gravity's Grasp (Unique Armor, Medium) (You can use the basic stats for a breastplate) Gravity's Grasp. AC 14 + Dex Mod (No Max +2) Niko is _always_ proficient with this armor Charges: 10 (Replenished on Long Rest) Horizon Mass (2 Charges): You reach into the depths of your essence and Will a greater mass to form giving your body a greater density. This extra mass can be moved, formed and controlled the same as you can your own body. The armor forms from this mass. This takes an Action to Don and an Action to Doff. You also gain the effects of the Powerful Built trait. (Powerful Build: You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.) Duration: 1 Hour Split: (5 Charges): As an Action you can separate yourself from your armor and leave it active. It can take the the following actions: Move, Dodge, Help. When you make an attack, if your armor is within range of the creature you're attacking, it can make an attack as well. You do not benefit from the increased AC of this armor while you are using this feature. The armor uses your attack stats. Your armor acts on your turn and can move up to 15 Feet at a time. Duration: 1 Minute Reconstitute (No Charges): You can take an Action to suppress the previous effects and subsume the mass and stop the effects. You recover half, rounded down, charges and any active effects of Gravity's Grasp end. Duration: Instant The plan is for this armor to literally grow with you. Gain more charges and more utility and functions as you grow. Let me know what you think. There's still some balancing to do because this is a _really_ strong magical weapon. But it fits to your story, and the unique creation of Niko himself while also being a hook for the adventure. It's not quite on par with Dove, but Dove is intentionally overtuned with some pretty glaring downsides should Tinman choose to utilize her. If this feels undertuned or overtuned, we can revisit.

    Your Lance still has Returning Weapon, and itself is made from your essence. But that's something I plan to expand on as we get through the story.


Kanadex, in his neurotic wisdom, gave Niko a specific time and day to be at the Happy Beholder. To order a 'Jade Tsunami', Luigi would know what it meant. And to wait for someone else coming in and ordering the same. They're going to lead Niko to the Lustre and to eventual answers about who and why him and Orvus were attacked.


Tinman searches for info on Orvus
