The center of the island is an aurory.
	- Benches used by giants.
	- Same island Koz was marooned on


The orrery is missing some of the planets and the moon. 

Found one of the planets and continued searching for the others, specifically the moon. Reciting mantras as searching.

Koz plays his Shamisen
	- furiously

The voice of Oloma guides me towards the southern part of the island. 

Koz has an interaction with his dogs from his past in a dream state. 

We finished putting the planets and moon back into the orrery. 

Triggered a magical affect of sorts. 
	- teleported to a room, almost shrine like
	- oh shit. we may be underwater
