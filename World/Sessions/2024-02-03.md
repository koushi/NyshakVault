Elven woman on a larger than normal horse.
- long robes

looks at Gavin, golden lights when affected by faerie fire

Gavin seems to have some connection with this woman. 
- the spear is familiar 

No realm is out of reach on my horse.

Jack awestruck by the woman or the horse.

Something about the horse seems off. Jack rolls insight to discern the nature of the horse.

Corellun, person from Gavin's past? Something about a disappointed god. 
Disappointment goes both ways.
She wants to know about Gavin's quest. Gavin regales her with SPL exploits. 
Gavin talking about new gods. 

Offers Gavin a blessing. "First time for everything" 
Small thistle. Should someone remove you from your current course. Blow on the thistle if you are ever trapped...*Hoovenaut* will deliver you. Single use. 

Gavin is getting tapped up for something. Switching courts?? 

She knows Jack. Be wary, a lot of people up there looking for you. What is going on??? "Give my regards to my master" or something like that

Hadrew fell asleep, never woke up avna.

Gavin vibe checks Jack.
