### Notes

knocked unconscious by Gavin and dragged away by Crippy. Tearbagged and a note with a message left on me.

Moved to the keep before anyone got back to return the message.

_Crippy's room_
Gutting the lamb over his bed. Ny'shak is going to put deep claw marks into the wall smear them with blood. Painted in entrails and viscera on the walls: The Silence is circling.... Like lambs to the slaughter This dance never ends. Cut in and savor the consequences?

_Gavin's room_
The Eyes never spared anyone. Scrawled on the walls in blood with the lambs head pinned to the wall.
