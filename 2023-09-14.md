## Fears and phobia expansion tips

- Make it specific. Rather than just "scared of heights", make it fear of clock towers, treetop walkways, or mountain ledges.
- Give it meaning. Connect it to a traumatic memory, like a childhood accident or loss. Fears rooted in character history feel more real.
- Make it inconvenient. Choose a phobia that will come up frequently for the character and in their adventuring. Fear of water, dark places, insects etc.
- Consider cultural fears. Things like ghosts, curses, disease, vermin, and darkness tend to show up frequently in folklore and legends.
- Look to real phobias. Fear of blood, needles, germs, vomiting, and tight spaces are common real-life phobias to inspire you.
- Distinguish fear from disgust. Disgust is revulsion, while fear also contains anxiety/panic. A disgust of slugs feels different than a phobia of them.
- Decide on severity. A mild hesitation around something induces roleplay without being debilitating. A severe, paralyzing phobia affects the story more.
- Give it symptoms. Describe how the character reacts physically and emotionally to the feared thing. Sweaty palms, racing heart, screaming, crying, freezing up.
- Make it inconvenient but surmountable. The phobia should disrupt and hinder at times, but not prevent all progress.
