The Spineback

"Listen round, Skarok tell you 'bout when I claimed the forest for me own," the jovial chef started as he prepared the menu of the day, Spineback Karaage with fresh greens  a yuzu shiso.

"I was a hunter and a butcher. My family ran a successful butcher shop in the Undergrowth, well successful in chrugs world. We chrugs, or chrugamkk, live on the outskirts of noble cities doing all the shit no one wants to do. Cooking, cleaning, hunting, killing, you name it. But enough with the history lesson!"

"There I was wandering the depths of my forest"
