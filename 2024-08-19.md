The Spineback

"I was a hunter and a butcher. My family ran a successful butcher shop in the Undergrowth, well successful in chrugs world. We chrugs, or chrugamkk, live on the outskirts of noble cities doing all the shit no one wants to do. Cooking, cleaning, hunting, killing, you name it. But enough with the history lesson!"

"There I was wandering the depths of my forest when I spotted it, a claw print of a Spineback. Spinebacks are nasty ones, sneaky too. They 'unt in pairs - like to bait in their prey.  The track was fresh maybe a few minutes old. I froze and scanned the trees looking for any signs of movement. I spotted nothing but something told me I was not alone. The sounds of the forest quieted as if not wanting to draw the ire of the predator lurking in it depths. Ol' Skarok did that plenty good. She barreled into me sending me ass over tea kettle to the forest floor. I barely managed to dodge her claws as I rolled away. Her frenzied attacks continued, herding me into the killzone. Fighting a spineback is madness, fighting 2 (huh...) something wrong with you. But I was not the bait, nor was I to be the prey. The trap sprung "
