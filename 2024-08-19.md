The Spineback

"Listen round, Skarok tell you 'bout when I claimed the forest for me own," the jovial chef started as he prepared the menu of the day, Spineback Karaage with fresh greens  a yuzu shiso.

"I was a hunter and a butcher. My family ran a successful butcher shop in the Undergrowth, well successful in chrugs world. We chrugs, or chrugamkk, live on the outskirts of noble cities doing all the shit no one wants to do. Cooking, cleaning, hunting, killing, you name it. But enough with the history lesson!"

"There I was wandering the depths of my forest when I spotted it, a claw print of a Spineback. Spinebacks are nasty ones, sneaky too. They 'unt in pairs - like to bait in their prey.  The track was fresh maybe a few minutes old. I froze and scanned the trees looking for any signs of movement. I spotted nothing but something told me I was not alone. The sounds of the forest quieted as if not wanting to draw the ire of the predator lurking in it depths. Ol' Skarok did that plenty good. She barreled into me sending me ass over tea kettle to the forest floor. I barely managed to dodge her claws as I rolled away. Her frenzied attacks continued, herding me into the killzone. Fighting a spineback is madness, fighting 2 (huh...) something wrong with you. But I was not the bait, nor was I to be the prey. Dozens of thick vines whipped from the underbrush pinning the spineback to the ground. I turned, drew  my spear and braced impact. The other murder lizard came with the fury of a scorned lover. We traded blows until neither could continue, by the time we stopped the spineback knew it would not live through the night. His golden eyes stared at me and I met his gaze. He nodded his head in respect and walked towards his mate in the trap. Barely alive I hurried along. The spineback was trying to break the vines around his mate. It was then I noticed the nearby nest. I cut the female free and collapsed against the tree. He didn't last long after that, a few minutes at most. She fled off into the depths. Half dead, I cut myself a chunk of meat and grilled it over the fire. Now eat ya seadreaming chrugs."
